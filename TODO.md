- [X] Need full narrative of the simulation - MY working on
- [ ] Ensure documents, agents, and narrative are aligned
- [ ] Do a full test run
- [ ] Create submit state for when they are done with their document and feedback screen - Worth probably seeing what Claude comes up with, but I also have some thoughts I can try to sketch at some point

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

## 💡 Ideas for Later

- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Add loading skeletons
- [ ] Implement better error messages
- [ ] Add tooltips for buttons and features

## 🔒 Security & Performance

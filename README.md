## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- An Anthropic API key for Claude

### Installation

1. Clone or download this project
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Make sure your `.env` file contains your Anthropic API key:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Application

You need to run both the backend server and frontend:

1. **Start the backend server** (in one terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
   This starts the Express server on http://localhost:4000

2. **Start the frontend** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This starts the React app on http://localhost:3000

3. **Open your browser** and go to http://localhost:3000

## 🎭 Team Members

The simulator includes 5 AI-powered team members:

- **👩‍💼 Sarah Chen** - Product Manager: Collaborative, user-focused, data-driven
- **👨‍💻 Mike Rodriguez** - Senior Developer: Technical, practical, solution-oriented
- **👩‍🎨 Lisa Kim** - UX Designer: Creative, user-experience focused, design-thinking
- **📊 Alex Thompson** - Data Analyst: Analytical, metrics-driven, evidence-based
- **📈 Jen Wilson** - Marketing Lead: Strategic, growth-focused, market-oriented

## ⚙️ Configuring Agents

1. Click on the **Agent Config** tab
2. Edit the personality prompt for each team member
3. Click **Save** to apply changes
4. Use **Reset Defaults** to restore original personalities

### Tips for Good Prompts:
- Define their role and expertise clearly
- Specify their communication style (formal, casual, etc.)
- Include what topics they care about most
- Mention how they typically contribute to discussions

## 💬 Using the Chat

1. Select a team member from the sidebar
2. Type your message and press Enter or click Send
3. Wait for the AI response (you'll see a "typing" indicator)
4. Continue the conversation naturally

**Example conversations:**
- "What do you think about this new feature idea?"
- "How should we prioritize our roadmap?"
- "What metrics should we track for success?"
- "Can you review this PRD draft?"

## 📋 Document Collaboration

1. Switch to the **Documents** tab
2. Write your Product Requirements Document in the editor
3. Click **"Get Feedback"** to generate AI-powered comments from your team
4. Review highlighted text sections - each team member can comment on multiple specific parts
5. Hover over highlights in the document to see which comments relate to which text
6. Use the sidebar to read detailed feedback with priority levels
7. Click **"Edit Document"** to return to editing mode
8. Click **"Get More Feedback"** to receive additional rounds of review

### Advanced Comment Features
- **Text-Specific Comments**: Each comment is tied to a specific section of your document
- **Multiple Comments per Person**: Team members can provide feedback on several different areas
- **Priority Levels**: Comments are color-coded (red=high, yellow=medium, blue=low priority)
- **Interactive Highlights**: Hover over highlighted text or comments to see connections
- **Role-Based Feedback**: Each team member focuses on areas relevant to their expertise

### Comment Generation
Comments are generated by individual team members using their existing personality prompts from the `agentPrompts` object in `src/claude_pm_simulation.js` (around line 11). Each team member analyzes the document and identifies 1-3 specific areas where they have feedback from their professional perspective.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Backend API
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/claude`
- **Port**: 4000
- **Payload**: 
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Your message",
    "history": [...],
    "systemPrompt": "Agent personality",
    "characterName": "Team member name",
    "characterRole": "Their role"
  }
  ```

### Frontend
- React 18 with functional components and hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling (loaded via CDN)
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Real-time chat interface

## 🔧 Scripts

- `npm start` - Start React development server
- `npm run server` - Start Express backend server
- `npm run dev` - Start backend with nodemon (auto-restart)
- `npm run build` - Build React app for production

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Port conflicts**: If ports 3000 or 4000 are in use:
- Kill existing processes: `lsof -ti:3000,4000 | xargs kill`
- Or change ports in the configuration

**API errors**: Check your `.env` file has the correct Anthropic API key

**Chat not working**: Ensure both servers are running and the backend API is accessible
